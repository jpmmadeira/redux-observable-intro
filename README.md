# Redux Observable Intro - Unicounter

In this project, we created a simple counter, with the purpose of exemplifying in three easy steps the differences between the use of `useState`, `redux` and redux with a middleware (`redux-observable`).

## Steps

### Step 1 - useState
A Counter component using `useState` hook to manage its own state.

### Step 2 - redux
In this step, we implemented a `redux` store and connected it with the counter component. Now, our state is managed globally.

### Step 3 - redux-observable
In this step, we added the `redux-observable` middleware, to intercept previously implemented redux actions before they are executed.
